Heterogeneity in the Multidimensional Child  Quality-Quantity Trade-off and Its Consequences for Intergenerational Mobility
</a>
</h4>  
<p style="text-align: justify;">        
<strong>Abstract</strong>: This paper studies the child quality-quantity trade-off by analyzing how family size and child outcomes change in response to a change in the cost of child quantity. I exploit the variation in the monetary penalty for an unauthorized second child under the One-Child Policy in rural China. I find evidence of a trade-off between family size and the health of the firstborn but no evidence for a trade-off between family size and the education or wealth of the firstborn. Further exploring the heterogeneity across parents, I find that the trade-off between family size and education exists only for high-skill workers' children, while the trade-off between family size and wealth exists only for farmers' or low-skill workers' children. Evidence suggests that the heterogeneity arises because of different expected returns to education and different opportunity costs of education when the parents work in different occupations. The results underline the importance of multidimensional child quality and heterogeneity across parental occupations. The heterogeneity in the quality-quantity trade-off contributes to the decline of intergenerational income mobility in China. While all parents are having fewer children, only children of high-skill workers become more likely to find a better job, migrate to cities, and earn a higher income when having fewer siblings.

<strong>Abstract</strong>: This paper examines the impact of early life exposure to tap water on children’s cognitive skills in later life. We exploit the variation in the timing of tap water connection across communities imposed by a major drinking water safety program in rural China. Using data extracted from the China Family Panel Studies, we find that one additional year of exposure to tap water in early life increases cognitive test score at ages 10-15 by 0.132 standard deviations. Event study estimates confirm that the beneficial impacts are concentrated in early life.

<strong>Abstract</strong>: This paper examines whether education plays an important role in shaping individuals’ gender role attitudes. We exploit the exogenous variation in temporal and geographical impacts of the 1986 Compulsory Education Law in China, which reduces the inequality in compulsory school attendance across regions. Using the data from the China General Social Survey, we find that the extra schooling induced by the compulsory schooling reform leads to more egalitarian gender role attitudes. Education’s liberalizing effect is concentrated among females and urban residents. However, the education’s impacts on gender-equal behavior are much weaker than that on attitudes. Finally, we discuss the potential channels through which education shapes individuals’ gender-role attitudes.

<strong>Abstract</strong>: Effectiveness of development aid is widely perceived to suffer in the presence of multiple donors with overlapping responsibilities. We test existing theory on aid fragmentation by studying aid provision under numerous donors throughout Afghanistan from 2006-2009. Leveraging granular military data on aid, conflict, corruption, and public opinion, we conduct the first micro-level analysis of aid fragmentation. When delivered by a single donor, aid reduces conflict, curtails corruption, and boosts public opinion. But under donor fragmentation, the benefits of aid are significantly reduced. We are able to distinguish among various causal pathways underlying these heterogeneous effects. Our findings are robust to accounting for a battery of novel observable confounding factors as well as a computational bounding exercise used to assess potential bias arising from unobserved factors. Our evidence suggests fragmentation facilitates corruption and erodes the ability of development aid to win ‘hearts and minds’ in the fight against insurgents. This study yields potentially actionable insights about improving government policy and public welfare outcomes in fragile and weakly institutionalized settings.

<strong>Abstract</strong>: This article uses China’s family planning policies to quantify and explain spillovers in fertility decisions. We test whether ethnic minorities decreased their fertility in response to the policies, although only the majority ethnic group, the Han Chinese, were subject to birth quotas. We exploit the policy rollout and variation in pre-policy age-specific fertility levels to construct a measure of the negative shock to Han fertility. Combining this measure with variation in the local share of Han, we estimate that a woman gives birth to 0.64 fewer children if the average completed fertility among her peers is exogenously reduced by one child. The fertility response of minorities is driven by cultural proximity with the Han and by higher educational investments, suggesting that spillovers operate through both social and economic channels. These results provide evidence that social multipliers can accelerate fertility transitions.

<strong>Abstract</strong>: 
    We study the long-term effects of <em>in utero</em> exposure to treated tap water on childhood health in rural China, where boiling water before drinking is common to remove disease-causing microorganisms. We exploit the gradual roll-out of a rural drinking water program that supplies treated tap water to households. Besides microorganisms, the treatment removes chemical pollutants. We find that exposure to treated tap water <em>in utero</em> increases height at ages 1--11 by 0.3 standard deviations. We also explore the impact on other health outcomes at different stages of childhood and the incidence of severe diseases by cause. Improving health by age one and inducing more health investments from parents are two possible channels. Results highlight the importance of removing chemical pollutants from drinking water in protecting fetuses from environmental insults.
